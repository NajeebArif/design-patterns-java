# Composite Pattern

### Composite Pattern: compose objects into tree structures to represent part whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

### Notes:
- Composite pattern allows clients to treat individual objects and composition of objects uniformly.
- A Component is any object in a composite structure.
- Components may be other components of leaves
- There are many design tradeoffs in implementing Composite. you need to balance transparency and safety with your needs.
